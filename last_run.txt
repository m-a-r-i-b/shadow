I have added the button to decrement the count below the increment button.

Action: VersionControlTool
Action Input: Commit and push the code in the current branch with an appropriate commit message
received arg =  Commit and push the code in the current branch with an appropriate commit message

> Entering new  chain...
Commit and push the code in the current branch with an appropriate commit message
I need to take the following actions:
- Stage all files
- Commit the changes with appropriate message '<message_here>'
- Push the changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<message_here>"
git push
```
Code: ['git add .', 'git commit -m "<message_here>"', 'git push']
Answer: Command 'git add .;git commit -m "<message_here>";git push' returned non-zero exit status 128.
